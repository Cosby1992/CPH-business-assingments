# Twitter-clone
## Task 1
See Assignment 5.

## Task 2
Implement the tiny twitter clone found at this repo, using only Redis as a data store.

You need to implement the two classes PostManagementImpl and UserManagementImpl, and to run the unit tests by right clicking the Java folder under Test, and choosing Run ‘All Tests’.
You are allowed to change the interface and DTOs, just write a small readme listing the changes.

## Task 3
In a readme, write a short explanation of your redis data model. It should be clear enough for a developer to be able to implement the same thing.
