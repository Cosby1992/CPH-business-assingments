# Assignment 2 - Databases 

## Solution

### Text
We have not finished the entire assignment yet, but we are working on it. You can find the answers to the text based questions in ```/report/assignment2.pdf```. The pdf is generated using LaTeX. 

### Code
#### **Bloom filter**
The solution to the bloom_filter problem can be found in ```/bloom_filter/bloom_filter.py```.

#### **Huffman Coding**
We have drawn the huffman tree in paint, a png image can be found in ```/huffman_coding/extra/HuffmanTree.png```.
It's also printed to the console when running the project. An expected output can be found in the **readme** of the ```huffman_coding``` folder.

It's almost done, we just couldn't figure out how to include the translation table in the compressed bit string according the huffman standart. It uses a Node class with a binary tree structure to decompress instead of reading a header with the translation info. 
The rest of this part of the assignment should be done :)
