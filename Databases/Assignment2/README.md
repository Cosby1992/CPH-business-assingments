# Assignment 2 - Databases 

## Solution

### Text
We have not finished the entire assignment yet, but we are working on it. You can find the answers to the text based questions in ```/report/assignment2.pdf```. The pdf is generated using LaTeX. 

### Code
#### Bloom filter
The solution to the bloom_filter problem can be found in ```/bloom_filter/bloom_filter.py```, you can run the file like any other  python project, by cloning this repo and running ```bloom_filter.py``` in your favorite editor. 

#### Huffman Coding
We are working hard to get this assignment done, you can see what we have so far in ```/huffman_coding/huffman_coding.py```. 
We have drawn the huffman tree in paint for now, a png image can be found in ```/huffman_coding/extra/huffman_tree.png```. 


We hope to resolve more of the assignment before it's time for review. You can of course not review the parts of the assignment that are not done, we are well aware of this. Sorry in advance :)
