# Assignment 2 - Databases 

## Solution

### Text
You can find the answers to the text based questions in ```assignment2.pdf```. The pdf is generated using LaTeX. 

### Solution
#### **Bloom filter**
The Bloom filter text solutions is found in the ```assignment2.pdf```.
The implementation of the bloom_filter problem can be found in ```/bloom_filter/bloom_filter.py```.

#### **Huffman Coding**
We have drawn the huffman tree in paint, a png image can be found in ```/huffman_coding/extra/HuffmanTree.png```.
An expected output, and how to run the python script yourself, can be found in the **readme** of the ```huffman_coding``` folder.

It's almost done, we just couldn't figure out how to include the translation table in the compressed bit string according the huffman standart. It uses a Node class with a binary tree structure to decompress instead of reading a header with the translation info. 
The rest of this part of the assignment should be done :)

#### **Map and Reduce**
The Map and Reduce task solutions can be found in section 4 in ```assignment2.pdf```. 
If you want to take a look at some of the code implementations that were made in Javascript they can be found in ```/map_reduce/map.js``` and ```/map_reduce/reduce.js```.
