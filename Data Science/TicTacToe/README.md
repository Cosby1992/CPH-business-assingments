# Datascience Assignment

Implement AI for tic-tac-toe using Minimax. If time permits, implement alpha-beta pruning as well.
### Language choice
We have used Python to solve this assignment

### Authors
Cosby1992, Stabz

# To Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Run main.py
3. Follow console instructions

# Features
### Gameplays:
Player vs Player

AI vs Player

AI vs AI

### Performance
#### Monitoring:
Number of prunes done by AI

Number of consideret moves by AI

Number of Total amount of board states from move

Time to evaluate move by AI

Best move score for AI



### Other
Console game menu loop with help command

Indication of when AI knows it won a game





# Files
##### minimax_aplha_beta.py: This file contains the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning enabled

##### minimax.py: Contains the minimax algorithm without pruning (Not used pr. default. Can be changed in top of game.py in imports)

##### board.py: Contains a board class that handle the board and players

##### game.py: contains code to handle games. Either two player, AI vs player or AI vs AI

##### main.py initializes game.py with a new game and prints a welcome message

##### constants.py: contains game constants like MAX_SCORE, MIN_SCORE etc.

##### OTHER FILES: not used in the game, is previous versions and helping files
