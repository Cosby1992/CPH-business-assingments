# Linear regression

We did unfortunately not finish all of this assignment, we have completed Task 1 and 2. Then we used a fair amount of time debugging the provided notebooks for the task. We have however read through the python notebooks, so we done some of the work for Task 3. 

## Solution
Our solution of the Linear Regression of the student scores can be found in the python notebook named ```student_scores_data _science.ipynb```. OBS: if you download it, remember the file. 
If you don't want to clone this entire repo to get the files, you can download the files using the links below:
