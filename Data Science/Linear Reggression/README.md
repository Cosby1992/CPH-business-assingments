# Linear regression

We did unfortunately not finish all of this assignment, we have completed Task 1 and 2. Then we used a fair amount of time debugging the provided notebooks for the task. We have however read through the python notebooks, so we done some of the work for Task 3. 

## Solution
Our solution of the Linear Regression of the student scores can be found in the python notebook named ```student_scores_data _science.ipynb```. OBS: if you download it, remember the file. You can download just the notebook here: https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Cosby1992/CPH-business-assingments/blob/master/Data%20Science/Linear%20Reggression/student_scores_data%20_science.ipynb
And the csv file can be downloaded here:
