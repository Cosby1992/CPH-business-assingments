\section*{Intro}
We are using the project Letter Frequencies downloaded 
from \url{https://github.com/CPHBusinessSoftUFO/letterfrequencies} 
in this paper. 

\section{Task 1}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find a point in your program that can be optimized (for speed), 
    for ex-ample by using a profiler
    \item Make a measurement of the point to optimize, for example by 
    running a number of times, and calculating the mean and standard 
    deviation (see the paper from Sestoft)
    \item If you work on the letter frequencies program, make it at least 50\% faster
\end{enumerate}
